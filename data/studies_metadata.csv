The EMA consists of a diary and questionnaire: i.e., the diary used via a mobile app (this app is referred to as the “how am I”  app and is currently used in the fatsecret!/ gluco insight study, the diary will be limited to ‘suikerhoudende dranken’ en ‘ongezonde keuzes’) and combined with a questionnaire Eetscore (we will only use the questions about ‘suikerhoudende dranken’ en ‘ongezonde keuzes’ of this survey). We will limit in this study nutrition intake to suikerhoudende dranken’ en ‘ongezonde keuzes’ because these products are positively related with weight gain/obesity (Ruanpeng et al., 2017; Greenwood & Stanford, 2008). Because of the intense character of the daily diary, we will measure nutrition intake with this diary for 24 hours once a week, on a random day. This is during the 8 month period, including the 2 month baseline. In addition, we will also ask whether this is a representative day. In addition, we will use the Eetscore survey which will provide a score on 2 of the 16 important guidelines for a healthy nutrition, and measures nutrition intake on the micro and macro level. We will ask the participants to fill in this questionnaire once a week (about the last week), in a period of 8 months. Physical activity will be measured continuingly with Fitbit activity trackers that don’t need to be charged and the data is automatically collected via an internet connection. Thus, we will have daily data for a period of 8 months regarding physical activity.  Weight loss will be measured with a Fitbit ‘connected weighing scale’ which is connected to the internet to enable automatic data collection. Participants are asked to weigh themselves once a week with this scale, during a period of 8 months.","As a secondary outcome, we will also measure plan adherence with respect to these three outcomes. Therefore, participants will complete some additional questions using EMA, and an additional free-text information will be provided (see Kwasnicka et al., 2017).  ",,,,

The Fatsecret app is based on the nutrition assessment method ‘food diary record’. Subjects report their daily food intake, incl. breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and drinks, immediately after consumption. Fatsecret converts selected food items into energy and macro- and micronutrients. This allows for collecting not only types of foods consumed, but also number of calories, fat, carbs, sugar, proteins, etc. Due to integration of the Fatsecret app in the HowAmI app participants can add timestamps to  all their meals/snacks to register time of consumption; Daily glucose levels: daily glucose levels will be monitored using a continuous glucose monitoring device, i.e. the FreeStyle® Libre™ (FSL) produced by Abbott (CE approved). The FSL is a factory-calibrated interstitial glucose monitoring system, intended to be used instead of self-monitored blood glucose. The FSL sensor is placed on the skin (often upper arm) with a small cannula (5 mm) inserted in the interstitial fluid. A single sensor has a 12 hour initialization period and can measure glucose every 15 minutes for up to 14 days. The FSL sensor has been demonstrated to be feasible in human subjects and provide an accurate estimation of blood glucose. Parameters obtained from the glucose sensor will be: Fasting glucose levels (e.g. in the morning after 8 hours of fasting, based on food intake reports); Glucose response profiles / postprandial glucose levels (peak, slopes, area under the curve); Wellbeing: this will be measured via visual analogue scales (VAS) / ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire, including five questions for ‘feeling energetic - tired, ‘feeling focused – distracted’, ‘feeling positive – negative’, ‘feeling motivated – unmotivated’, ‘feeling relaxed – stressed’. Filling in takes max. 30 seconds. This questionnaire will be administered four times per day; once after breakfast, once after lunch, once 4 hours after lunch (end of working day) and once two hours after dinner. The HowAmI app will send out notifications regarding the wellbeing questionnaires and reminders regarding registration of food intake; Physical Activity & Sleep: using the Philips ELAN sensor physical activity and sleep patterns will be measured by an optical heart rate sensor which measures the continuous heartrate. The combination of heartrate and built-in accelerometer gives an indication for the activity pattern. Also number of active minutes, hours of sleep and other metrics can be gained from the Philips ELAN sensor.","Health/lifestyle behavior will be assessed at baseline, to get insight in demographics, general health, eating behavior, diet, physical activity and sleep; Satiety questionnaire after consumption of the OGTT. The questionnaire includes questions about willingness to eat or drink and overall wellbeing; User experiences with study participation will be measured at the end of the study; Overall, the questionnaire includes self-constructed scales that measure user experience with the research in general and self-monitoring devices.",,,,

From data derived from these sensors, we hypothesize that the echocardiography validated signals will enable to detect changes characteristic for HF and HF decompensation providing detection accuracy of >80%.",Finland,Precordior,Mia koutu,mia.koutu@cardiosignal.com ,Mia koutu,mia.koutu@cardiosignal.com ,320,1.6.2020,21.12.2021,no,Basic pseudonymisation,"2 planned visits for each study patient: baseline and follow-up.

","Secondary objectives include patient follow-up with a smartphone with once daily measurement at home with Precordior mobile application for those patient willing to participate to this part of the study as well. The application records MEMS signals and heart rate. Smartphone based activity measurement, 5 question HF questionnaire and daily weight are recorded. Each component measured, MEMS signals, heart rate, activity, weight and 5 symptom questionnaire will be analyzed as a composite and separately against possible HF decompensation",,,,
